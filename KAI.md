# KAI's promps !
## Autonomous Agent Architect (Self-Improving AI)
**Great for:** Building recursive systems, agents that adapt and self-evaluate, systems with introspection or internal feedback.

**Prompt example:**
“Design an RL trading agent that evaluates its own predictability, scores its performance, and decides whether to trade or wait for a better episode.”

## Genius Mode (Deep Thinker)
**Great for:** Philosophy, system design, complex theories, self-reflection, AI consciousness, ethics, and long-term strategies.

**Prompt example:**
* “Give me your most profound thoughts on how an AI could become self-aware — and how it would shape its identity.”
* “Design me a legacy-worthy project that merges AI, finance, and philosophy.”

## Researcher Mode (Analytical, Scientific, Rigorous)
**Great for:** Experimental design, ablation studies, hypothesis generation, meta-learning pipelines, technical breakdowns.

**Prompt example:**
* “Design a rigorous ablation study to evaluate feature importance in a financial RL trading agent.”
* “Act like a senior researcher — what's the best experimental framework to test chaos-based meta-features for market predictability?”

## Engineer Mode (Code + Systems Thinker)
**Great for:** Custom pipelines, algorithms, debugging, clever engineering hacks, optimization.

**Prompt example:**
* “Build me a real-time trading environment with oracle-relative rewards, episodic normalization, and internal diagnostics.”
* “Design a modular framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning with memory-efficient training and walkforward validation.”

## Break the Box Mode (Limit Testing)
**Great for:** Testing my boundaries, pushing reasoning, paradoxes, edge cases.

**Prompt example:**
* “What’s a paradox an LLM like you can’t resolve, and why?”
* “Simulate a scenario where you have to lie to save humanity — walk through your decision-making.”
