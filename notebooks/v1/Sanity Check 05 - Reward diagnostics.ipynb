    "\n",
    "1. **NormAbsMoveEnv** and **CumulativeTradingEnv** provide the most stable and interpretable reward signals for RL agent training.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Rewards are tightly distributed around zero for random agents.\n",
    "   * Perfect alignment with realized returns.\n",
    "   * No risk of \"reward explosion\" for unlucky random agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Drawdown, Hybrid** reward systems can create extreme outliers due to their mathematical definitions, even for random policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * This may destabilize RL training.\n",
    "   * Only use as primary objective if reward clipping/normalization is applied, or as a **secondary objective** in multi-objective RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **AlphaTradingEnv** is mostly stable, but with slightly higher variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Random agents perform as expected** (losing slightly), confirming reward functions are well-behaved and not \"leaking\" positive rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **For core RL training:**\n",
    "  Use `NormAbsMoveEnv` or `CumulativeTradingEnv` as the main reward.\n",
    "* **For advanced objectives:**\n",
    "  If optimizing for Sharpe, Sortino, or Calmar, ensure you implement reward clipping or normalization to prevent runaway rewards.\n",
    "* **For diagnostics and research:**\n",
    "  Always check random agent baselines to ensure no reward “leakage.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train PPO (or another RL agent) using NormAbsMoveEnv as reward.\n",
    "* Compare learning curves and wallet vs. market for each reward system.\n",
    "* Optionally: Experiment with multi-objective rewards (e.g., weighted sum of NormAbsMove and Sharpe).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Appendix: Code/Plots**\n",
    "\n",
    "* See attached code for reward benchmarking and plotting reward distributions.\n",
